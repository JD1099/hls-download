# **This package is silly and probably will not work.**
I have a bad habbit of making arbitrary code. As you may have read from the import name, this project only contains client-side code.

Eventually I will upload the server-side scripts, but I'm afraid to reveal my very very insecure server-side code to the internet.

After I have throughly secured my code I will be more than happy to share it.


This is my very first python project. Feel free to give any advise as I am eager to learn new things.

The purpose of this project is to create a tool that can download hls streams.

By all measn feel free to parse through my messy code and make it compatible for yourself.
